Summary:
This application will allow users to create and manage a tournament event with multiple teams.  Users will be able to add various rounds to the tournament.  From there users will be able to add different matches to each round and add the teams to the matches.

Matches will have a home team and an away team as well as a way to mark which team has won the match.  Once all matches in a round have a winner, the app will automatically create a new round and randomly assign the winners from the previous round into various matches.  This process will continue until only one team remains, who is declared the winner of the tournament.
